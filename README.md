py-cachify is a library that provides small but useful cache utilities.

Some parts were heavily inspired by [douglasfarinelli's python-cachelock](https://github.com/douglasfarinelli/python-cachelock) lib,
which is sadly no longer maintained.

py-cachify works well in both sync and async environments, has 100% test coverage, 
is backend agnostic (you can provide your own client as long as it matches the signature), and supports Python from 3.8 and upward.

It offers cache-based locks and decorators for securing function executions and storing their results in the cache.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation can be found at https://py-cachify.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

## Installation
To install:
```bash
pip install py-cachify

# or if using poetry
poetry add py-cachify
```

## Examples

To start working with it, you'll have to initialize it using `init_cachify`:
```python
from py_cachify import init_cachify

init_cachify()
```
By default, it will use an in-memory cache.

If you want to use Redis:
```python
from py_cachify import init_cachify
from redis.asyncio import from_url as async_from_url
from redis import from_url

init_cachify(sync_client=from_url(redis_url), async_clien=async_from_url(async_redis_client))
```
Normally you wouldn't have to use both sync and async clients since an application usually works in a single mode i.e. sync/async.

Once initialized you can use everything that the library provides straight up without being worried about managing the cache yourself. 

If you forgot to call `init_cachify` the `CachifyInitError` will be raised during runtime.
```python
from py_cachify import once


# Make sure there is just one copy of a function running at a time
@once(key='long_running_function')
async def long_running_function() -> str:
    # Executing long-running operation...
    pass
```
